## How to Work with This Project

### Updating Content

The project follows a content-first approach with data stored in the `content.js` file. To update any content on the website:

1. Open `content.js` in your preferred code editor
2. Locate the section you want to update (contact info, skills, work experience, etc.)
3. Modify the existing data or add new entries
4. Save the file and refresh the website to see your changes

For example, to add a new project:

```javascript
// In content.js
projects: [
    // Existing projects...
    {
        name: "New Project Name",
        dates: "MM/YYYY-MM/YYYY",
        description: [
            "Description point 1",
            "Description point 2",
            "Description point 3"
        ]
    }
]
```

### Modifying the Design

The design is controlled by the `styles.css` file in the `assets/css` directory. The stylesheet is organized into logical sections with comments to help you locate specific styles:

1. Open `assets/css/styles.css`
2. Find the section you want to modify (header, sections, contact information, etc.)
3. Update the CSS properties as needed
4. Save the file and refresh the website to see your changes

### Adding New Features

If you want to add new sections or features:

1. Add the new content data to `content.js` in an appropriate format
2. Update the HTML structure in `index.html` to include the new section
3. Add any necessary CSS styles in `assets/css/styles.css`
4. Enhance the JavaScript functionality in `assets/js/main.js` to populate the new section
